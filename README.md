# wordle
this tool helps you solve wordle riddle
It needs a wordlist-file


the worlde tool helps you in 3 ways

1) you can create wordlists based on open source dictionaries and filter the words based on number of letters.
2) it actually solves the riddle based on your hints (you can hint which letters are in the word and which of those are at correct positions, and you can hint which letters are not in the word at all).
3) it will suggest testwords to get more letters (based on your hints and a probability-table for the letters)
